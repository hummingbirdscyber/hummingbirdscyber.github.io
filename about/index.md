Hummingbirds Cyber Team is founded with the passion of learning by group of university students at September 2018. We love to learn new things about computer science especially cyber security and artificial intelligence. 

We sometimes program tools that facilitating our work during CTFs or bug bounties, you can access these tools from [our github account](https://github.com/hummingbirdscyber). 

Every cyber security enthusiast love to hack vulnerable machines on Vulnhub, Hack the box etc. and of course we too. So, we will try to share our walkthroughs in this blog or our personal blogs.

Sometimes, we develop educational materials to help newcomers into this field such as [OWASP Vulnerable Web Application](https://github.com/OWASP/Vulnerable-Web-Application) and [HackInOS Vulnerable VM](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hackinos-1,295/). 

If we need to summarize ourselves shortly, we are CTF players,cyber security and ai enthusiasts,programming lovers and lazy students(very).
